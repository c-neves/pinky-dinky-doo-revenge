# Pinky Dinky Doo Revenge
## Description
First Year college assignment. A Windows game built using the <a href="http://winbgim.codecutter.org/" target="_blank">WinBGIM</a> library coded in the C language. <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/" target="_blank">Code::Blocks</a> was the IDE used to code and compile. **Compiled under Windows 8.1 64 bits.**

## The Game
The game is a bomberman gameplay slash pacman graphics rip off. It's basically bomberman with some pacman textures.
You play as Pinky Dinky Doo, the pink ghost in pacman, and you are back to take revenge on that yellow sucker that ate you too many times; exploding him into oblivion.

## Be aware of bugs
Sometimes, the audio library crashes the game.

You can avoid this by disabling the audio in the code or by using `Pink Dink Doo Revenge (no_audio).exe`.
